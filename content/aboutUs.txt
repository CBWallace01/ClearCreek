<p>Clear Creek Properties is a family owned local business. A father and son team, Eddie and Brad Wallace, founded the company in 2018 after realizing a need for a different kind of real estate investor in North Alabama. While researching real estate investment opportunities, they realized there were many avenues to get started. Their research continually led them to the local county courthouses, where real estate investors meet to bid on foreclosed properties. While purchasing properties from a foreclosure auction can be lucrative for the investor, Eddie and Brad realized this method did nothing to serve the prior homeowners.  Additionally, they realized selling homes through the traditional real estate process isnâ€™t always in the best interest of the homeowner. So, after much research and careful thought Clear Creek Properties was established to serve homeowners across North Alabama.</p>
