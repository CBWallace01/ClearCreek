<p>Clear Creek Properties offers a stress free solution for homeowners looking to sell their property quickly for cash. Unlike listing a home with a realtor, the homeowner can get a cash offer in as little as 24 hours and the entire process can be completed in as little as one week. Additionally, this process allows the homeowner to sell without the hassle of required repairs.  While any homeowner may chose to sell to a cash buyer, certain circumstances generally indicate a strong need:
<ul>
<li>Inheriting an unwanted property</li>
<li>Moving</li>
<li>Offer on a new home, contingent on sale of your current home</li>
<li>Divorce</li>
<li>Facing Bankruptcy or Foreclosure</li>
<li>Need to sell quickly</li>
</ul>
